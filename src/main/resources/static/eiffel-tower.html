   <h3> Need to know about the Eiffel Tower </h3>
    <p> Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed
        as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary
        of the French Revolution. Although initially criticised by some of France's leading
        artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon
        of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The tower
        received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022. The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument
        with an entrance fee in the world: 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was
        designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.

        <br> <br>

        The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building
        , and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft)
        on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument
        to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years
        until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first
        structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due
        to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now
        taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the
        Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau
        Viaduct.</p>
