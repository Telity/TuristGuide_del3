    <h3> Need to know about the Round Tower </h3>
    <p> The Round Tower (Danish: Rundetårn) is a 17th-century tower in Copenhagen,
        Denmark, one of the many architectural projects of Christian IV of Denmark.
        Built as an astronomical observatory, it is noted for its equestrian staircase,
        a 7.5-turn helical corridor leading to the platform at the top (34.8 meters above ground),
        and its views over Copenhagen.

        The tower is part of the Trinitatis Complex which also includes a chapel,
        the Trinitatis Church, and an academic library, which were the first facilities
        of the Copenhagen University Library founded in 1482.

        Astronomy had grown in importance in 17th-century Europe. Countries had begun
        competing with each other in establishing colonies, creating a need for accurate
        navigation across the oceans. Many national observatories were therefore established,
        the first in 1632 at Leiden in the Dutch Republic. Only five years later the Round
        Tower Observatory, first referred to as STELLÆBURGI REGII HAUNIENSIS, would follow.</p>
